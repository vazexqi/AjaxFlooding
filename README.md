Tests whether browers will swap the request and response for AJAX when
we flood the calls.

### How to use

1. npm install (do this only once) to setup the 'connect' framework.
1. npm start
1. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000
1. Open up the chrome debugger and see if there are any swapping. If
   they are then it will also break at that point.
